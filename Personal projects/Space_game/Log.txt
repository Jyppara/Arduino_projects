    Starting the project.
    Wiring ready.
    First testing the wiring with a template code. Push button isn't reacting. LCD is working fine.
    Pushbutton wiring fixed. Template code works perfectly.
    Testing LCD screen functionality with own test code.
    Pushbutton state stays HIGH even when not pushing the button, but keeping finger close to it.
    10k pull down resistor fixed the issue.
    Started coding the first game: Space Ship- game.
    First game has now one moving asteroid and the spaceship.
    Game stops when the asteroid hits the spaceship and displays the score on the Game Over- screen.
    Code is not organized properly yet.
