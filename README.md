# Arduino_projects
Repository for Arduino Uno projects.
Projects help to understand more embedded systems and were helpful for passing University courses such as Microcontrollers course.
Projects include learning how to program microcontrollers and use electronic parts such as capacitors, DC motor, diodes, LEDs,
resistors, H-bridge, LCD, potentiometers, pushbuttons, piezo, photoresistor, servo motor, temperature sensor, tilt sensor and transistor.
